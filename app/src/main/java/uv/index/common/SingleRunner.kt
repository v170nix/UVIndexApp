/**
 * Class which guarantees single execution of blocks passed to [runInIsolation] by cancelling the
 * previous call. [runInIsolation] is backed by a [Mutex], which is fair, so concurrent callers of
 * [runInIsolation] will trigger in order, with the last call winning (by cancelling previous calls)
 *
 * When priorities are used, if the currently running block has a higher priority, the new one is
 * cancelled. If the currently running block has lower priority, currently running block is
 * cancelled.
 * If they have equal priority:
 *  * if cancelPreviousInEqualPriority == true, existing block is cancelled
 *  * if cancelPreviousInEqualPriority == false, new block is cancelled
 *
 * Note: When a block is cancelled, the outer scope (which called runInIsolation) is NOT cancelled.
